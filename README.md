# Starscan
Starscan is atool used for port scanning. It's a threaded scanner
that scans for open ports in a network. It's lightweight and made
with Python. I am still currently working on this project as it's my first
and with 1.0 there will be features such as:

* nmap integration
* Individual port scanning
* Port information
